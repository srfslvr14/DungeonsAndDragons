Three.js library implementation to create a 3d rendered scene of a famous tabletop game

To use: download directory and run lab5.html on a localhost server, and page should render via localhost:8000.
A much easier and simpler way to view this program and the code inside of it is to follow the following link and click on the 'lab5.html' file shown: https://people.ucsc.edu/~srfulgha/lab5/

Notice: the rogue.obj file varies between the github refrence and the srfulgha server version of lab5.html. This is due to the size of onenof the obj files, however both versions of the code run perfectly and display very similar scenes.
